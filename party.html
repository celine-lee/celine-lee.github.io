  <h1>Fun</h1>
  <body bgcolor="ffffff" text="#000000">
    <p>A running list of some of my favorite activities I have ideated or actually executed with friends. Not all of them have yet been done, many of the ideas are inspired from other people having done them, and all of them are up for additional creative interpretation. Figured it would be fun to share. Make a pull request to suggest any.</p>
    <h2>Themes</h2>

      <li>anything but cups (byo and get creative-- e.g. pool noodle, lined kleenex box, pie tin)</li>
      <li>backpack party (everyone brings something to share in a backpack (e.g. bouncy balls, lollipops, drinks, a bunch of loose pizza slices). everyone is now a mystery box)</li>
      <li>yearbook (construct a yearbook over the course of the party. draw attendees in as they enter, assign them to a class / staff member / superlative. people sign over the night. draw memories and inside jokes in.)</li>
